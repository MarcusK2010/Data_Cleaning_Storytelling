# Data Cleaning & Storytelling

In a nutshell: For a computer accessory company we need to analyse various datasets:

`brands` --> contains data regarding the brands the company is selling, i.e. name in long and short version
`orders` --> contains all orders, i.e. order ids, order date, status and sum total
`orderlines` --> contains all the different articles in the orders
`products` --> contains all products in the company's portfolio

After the analysis of the data we were asked to answer the following questions@

1.	How should products be classified into different categories to simplify reports and analysis?
2.	What is the distribution of product prices across different categories?
3.	How many products are being discounted?
4.	How big are the offered discounts as a percentage of the product prices?
5.	How do seasonality and special dates (Christmas, Black Friday) affect sales?
6.	How could data collection be improved?
