# Data Cleaning & Storytelling

In a nutshell: For a computer accessory company we need to analyse various datasets:

`brands` --> contains data regarding the brands the company is selling, i.e. name in long and short version
`orders` --> contains all orders, i.e. order ids, order date, status and sum total
`orderlines` --> contains all the different articles in the orders
`products` --> contains all products in the company's portfolio

After the analysis of the data we were asked to answer the following questions:

* How should products be classified into different categories to simplify reports and analysis?
* What is the distribution of product prices across different categories?
* How many products are being discounted?
* How big are the offered discounts as a percentage of the product prices?
* How do seasonality and special dates (Christmas, Black Friday) affect sales?
* How could data collection be improved?

To Answer these questions I did the following:

1. Data Cleaning
2. Data Quality Check & Data Analysis
3. Discount Analysis & Product Categorisation
4. Further Data Exploration

These stepps are documented in the following notebooks:

1. --> `Project_Data_Cleaning_Storytelling_Part_1_Overview_Data_Cleaing.ipynb`
2. --> `Project_Data_Cleaning_Storytelling_Part_2_Data_Quality_Data_Analysis.ipynb`
3. --> `Project_Data_Cleaning_Storytelling_Part_3_Discount_Analysis_Product_Categorisation.ipynb`
4. --> `Project_Data_Cleaning_Storytelling_Part_4_Further_Explration.ipynb`

There is also a long version of the above mentioned notebooks --> `Project_Data_Cleaning_Storytelling_Part_4_Further_Explration.ipynb`

To conclude the project I aslo prepared a short presentation --> `Group 1 - Project 3.pdf`
